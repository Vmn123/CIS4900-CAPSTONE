# TESLA Project for CAPSTONE: INFORMATION SYSTEMS CIS 4900.
# Overview
Elon Musk had stated that Tesla would manufacture 1,500 Model 3 cars in 2017 and increase output to 5,000 vehicles per week (total of 65,000 cars). By the end of 2017, Tesla had surpassed both Ford and GM to claim the title of most valued American electric vehicle manufacturer. In 2016, Elon Musk revealed the second phase of his grand plan for the organization, outlining how it would carry out its mission to quicken sustainable energy development.
With the aim to sell millions of electric vehicles annually by 2030, Tesla, Inc. is a business that seeks to accelerate the global switch to sustainable energy. As Tesla, Inc. develops new technology integrated into its vehicles, all qualified students and new workers should have access to a variety of new jobs. The rise of the global economy will now be supported by Tesla's most recent approach to creating new positions.

# Insight
- Our goal was to set out and utilize data to identify states where Tesla Inc. would benefit from local newly graduated individuals looking to enter the workforce. 
- By analyzing data from several states, regions, and educational institutions and drilling down to majors relevant to potential functions at Tesla, we were able to successfully meet the business goal. 
- We can now make a recommendation supported by data of which U.S. States Tesla can consider to open manufacturing operations where it can quickly fulfill its candidate pool. 
- We have identified that Tesla can quickly meet its need for candidates in eastern states, such as New York, or Pennsylvania and western states, such as California or Texas given its relatively high number of graduates from specialized fields related to Information Technology and Engineering.
