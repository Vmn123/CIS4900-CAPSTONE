# CIS4900-CAPSTONE
TESLA Project for CAPSTONE: INFORMATION SYSTEMS CIS 4900.

- Our goal was to set out and utilize data to identify states where Tesla Inc. would benefit from local newly graduated individuals looking to enter the workforce. 
- By analyzing data from several states, regions, and educational institutions and drilling down to majors relevant to potential functions at Tesla, we were able to successfully meet the business goal. 
- We can now make a recommendation supported by data of which U.S. States Tesla can consider to open manufacturing operations where it can quickly fulfill its candidate pool.â€¯
